# Mailchimp 

This package models Mailchimp data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/mailchimp). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i8JjWRgP4bDcL-TYv5flABglA_aOBXxA_OF-j1hsDcM/edit#slide=id.g244d368397_0_1).

The main focus of the package is to transform the 'recipient' and 'activity' tables into analytics-ready models and use that data to provide aggregate metrics about campaigns, automations, lists, members, and segments.

## Models

This package contains transformation models, designed to work simultaneously [Mailchimp source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_mailchimp_source). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below. Intermediate models are used to create these output models.

| model                         | description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mailchimp__automation_emails   | Each record represents an automation email (that make up automations), enriched with click, open, and unsubscribe metrics. This output is enabled if you are using automations.       |
| mailchimp__automations         | Each record represents an automation in Mailchimp, enriched with click, open, and unsubscribe metrics. This output is enabled if you are using automations.                            |
| mailchimp__campaign_activities | Each record represents an activity taken in relation to a campaign email, enriched with data about when the campaign was sent and the lag between send and the activity. |
| mailchimp__campaign_recipients | Each record represents the send of a campaign email, enriched with click, open, and unsubscribe metrics.                                                                  |
| mailchimp__campaigns           | Each record represents a campaign in Mailchimp, enriched with click, open, and unsubscribe metrics.                                                                       |
| mailchimp__lists               | Each record represents a list in Mailchimp, enriched with campaign metrics, (optional) automation metrics, and (optional) information about members.                               |
| mailchimp__members             | Each record represents a member in Mailchimp, enriched with campaign metrics and (optional) automation metrics.                                                        |
| mailchimp__segments            | Each record represents a segment in Mailchimp, enriched with campaign metrics and (optional) automation metrics. This output is enabled if you are using segments.                  |

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/mailchimp
    version: [">=0.7.0", "<0.8.0"]
```

## Package Maintenance
The Fivetran team maintaining this package **only** maintains the latest version. We highly recommend you keep your `packages.yml` updated with the [dbt hub latest version](https://hub.getdbt.com/fivetran/mailchimp/latest/). You may refer to the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md) and release notes for more information on changes across versions.

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Mailchimp data in the `mailchimp` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Mailchimp data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    mailchimp_schema: your_schema_name
    mailchimp_database: your_database_name
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Mailchimp staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_mailchimp`) and the Mailchimp final models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_mailchimp`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Mailchimp data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
  mailchimp:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
  mailchimp_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema

```

## Disabling models

It's possible that your Mailchimp connector does not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Mailchimp or actively excluded some tables from your syncs. To disable the corresponding functionality in the package, you must add the relevant variables. By default, all variables are assumed to be `true`. Add variables for only the tables you would like to disable:  

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  mailchimp_using_automations: false #disable if you do not have the automation_email, automation_email, or automation_recipient_activity tables
  mailchimp_using_segments: false #disable if you do not have the segment table
```

## Database Support
This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, and Postgres.

## Dependencies
This dbt package is dependent on the following dbt packages. Please be aware that these dependencies are installed by default within this package. For more information on the following packages, refer to the [dbt hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) site.
> IMPORTANT: If you have any of these dependent packages in your own `packages.yml` file, we highly recommend that you remove them from your root `packages.yml` to avoid package version conflicts.
    
```yml
packages:
    - package: fivetran/fivetran_utils
      version: [">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]

    - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
      version: [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]

    - package: fivetran/mailchip_source
      version: [">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]
