# Mailchimp 

This is a change.

This package models Mailchimp data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/mailchimp). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i8JjWRgP4bDcL-TYv5flABglA_aOBXxA_OF-j1hsDcM/edit#slide=id.g244d368397_0_1).

The main focus of the package is to transform the 'recipient' and 'activity' tables into analytics-ready models and use that data to provide aggregate metrics about campaigns, automations, lists, members and segments.

### Models

The primary outputs of this package are described below. There are several intermediate models to create these output models.

| model                         | description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mailchimp_automation_emails   | Each record represents an automation email (that make up automations), enriched with click, open and unsubscribe metrics. (Enabled if you are using automations.)        |
| mailchimp_automations         | Each record represents an automation in Mailchimp, enriched with click, open and unsubscribe metrics. (Enabled if you are using automations.)                            |
| mailchimp_campaign_activities | Each record represents an activity taken in relation to a campaign email, enriched with data about when the campaign was sent and the lag between send and the activity. |
| mailchimp_campaign_recipients | Each record represents the send of a campaign email, enriched with click, open and unsubscribe metrics.                                                                  |
| mailchimp_campaigns           | Each record represents a campaign in Mailchimp, enriched with click, open and unsubscribe metrics.                                                                       |
| mailchimp_lists               | Each record represents a list in Mailchimp, enriched with campaign metrics, (optionally) automation metrics and information about members.                               |
| mailchimp_members             | Each record represents a member in Mailchimp, enriched with campaign metrics and (optionally) automation metrics.                                                        |
| mailchimp_segments            | Each record represents a segment in Mailchimp, enriched with campaign metrics and (optionally) automation metrics. (Enabled if you are using segments.)                  |

## Upcoming changes with dbt version 0.17.0

As a result of functionality being released with version 0.17.0 of dbt, there will be some upcoming changes to this package. The staging/adapter models will move into a seperate package, `mailchimp_source`, that defines the staging models and adds a source for Mailchimp data. The two packages will work together seamlessly. By default, this package will reference models in the source package, unless the config is overridden. 

There are a few benefits to this approach:
* For users who want to manage their own transformations, they can still benefit from the source definition, documentation and staging models of the source package.
* For users who have multiple sets of Mailchimp data in their warehouse, a package defining sources doesn't make sense. They will have to define their own sources and union that data together. At that point, they will still be able to make use of this package to transform their data.

When this change occurs, we will release a new version of this package.
