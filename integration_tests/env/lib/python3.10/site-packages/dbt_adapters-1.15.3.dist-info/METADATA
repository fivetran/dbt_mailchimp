# Adapters

There are two major adapter types: [base](/dbt-adapters/src/dbt/adapters/base/impl.py) and [sql](/dbt-adapters/src/dbt/adapters/sql/impl.py).

## `base`

`BaseAdapter` defines the base functionality an adapter is required to implement in order to function with `dbt-core`.
There are several methods which have default implementations as well as methods that require the concrete adapter to implement them.

## `sql`

`SQLAdapter` inherits from `BaseAdapter`, updates default implementations to work with SQL-based platforms,
and defines additional required methods to support those defaults.

# Components

An adapter is composed of several components.

- connections
- dialect
- relation caching
- integration with `dbt-core`

The first two are platform-specific and require significant implementation in a concrete adapter.
The last two are largely implemented in `dbt-adapters` with minor adjustments in a concrete adapter.

## Connections

This component is responsible for creating and managing connections to storage and compute.

#### Files
- `dbt/adapters/{base|sql}/connections.py`

## Dialect

This component is responsible for translating a request from `dbt-core` into a specific set of actions on the platform.

#### Files
- `dbt/adapters/base/column.py`
- `dbt/adapters/base/query_headers.py`
- `dbt/adapters/base/relation.py`
- `dbt/adapters/relation_configs/*`
- `dbt/adapters/clients/jinja.py`
- `dbt/include/global_project/*`

## Relation caching

This component is responsible for managing a local cache of relations, relation metadata, and dependencies between relations.

#### Files
- `dbt/adapters/cache.py`

## Integration with `dbt-core`

This component is responsible for managing the interface between `dbt-core` and a concrete adapter.

#### Files
- `dbt/adapters/{base|sql}/impl.py`
- `dbt/adapters/base/meta.py`
- `dbt/adapters/base/plugin.py`
